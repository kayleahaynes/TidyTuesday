5th December 2013
- alliance (a1a) formed
- MR had 28/32 records (just taken Kalamari desert)
(bar chart for number of records, tree type map for records held and how long for)
- missing moofarm 1 and 3 lap, DK jungle parkway 3 lap, toadsturnpike lap
- tied with VAJ on KTP beach

8th December 2013
- VAJ beat MR KTP beach but in same day MR tied then got toadsturnpike lap and moomoo farm lap

moomoo farm - has a random element so makes it really hard to beat. TJL is a course specialist (plot on #records on tracks by same player) (correlation type plot) - 27.82 "a time he described as a once in a lifetime record"

Lacey dominates DKJL - held record for over 10 years - 14 times in a row (count of how many records held in a row)

Early 2014 Jamie, zoran and MJ chipped away at records

when someone took a record MR too it back with a matter of days (barbell showing number of days from someone taking record and MR getting it back)

May 2014
- Dan beat Matthias back, could keep up with MR, push total to 26

July 2015
- new DK strategy by Lacey - more time to save over lap record

October 2015
- MR had both DK records

November 20th 2015
5th record in month - 31/32 (moomoo flap missing, only record never held before)
unable to play to 23rd, abney317 posted a new record on bowser castle, one of MRs oldest records. MR beat it the next day

(abney317 holds a lot of shortcut records, look at the stats)

abney317 desert unoptimised track

abney went on the attack, jan 2016 4 new records in 5 days

MR plays less in the summer

October 2016
